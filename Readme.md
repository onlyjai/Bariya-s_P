# Crowdfunding Platform Smart Contract

## Vision

The Crowdfunding Platform project aims to create a decentralized way for individuals and organizations to raise funds for their projects. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform ensures that crowdfunding is transparent, secure, and immutable, allowing creators to raise funds while providing contributors with assurance that their contributions are being properly tracked.

## Features

- **Create Crowdfunding Project**: Users can create new crowdfunding projects with a goal amount and project details.
- **Contribute to Project**: Contributors can make donations to support a project, and all contributions are recorded on-chain for transparency.
- **Track Funding**: The platform keeps track of the total funds contributed toward each project, allowing creators and contributors to monitor progress.

## Contract Address

- **Network**: Aptos Mainnet/Testnet
- **Contract Address**: `0x0de196a858be039452477419984b6d5aec9ca53058d1a42ad354e98739c5d4a5`

## How It Works

1. **Create Crowdfunding Project**:

   - Users call the `create_project` function to create a new project for crowdfunding.
   - The function takes the project name and goal amount as input and stores the project details securely on the blockchain.

2. **Contribute to Project**:
   - Users can call the `contribute_to_project` function to contribute to a project.
   - The contract updates the total funds raised for the project and ensures the contributions are recorded immutably.

## Future Scope

- **Milestone-Based Funding Release**: Implement a milestone-based funding release system, where contributions are only transferred to the project creator when specific milestones are met.
- **Refund for Unsuccessful Projects**: Add functionality to allow contributors to receive refunds if the project does not reach its funding goal by a certain deadline.
- **Tiered Rewards for Contributors**: Introduce a reward system where contributors can receive perks based on the amount they contribute to the project.
- **Voting Mechanism**: Develop a voting mechanism where contributors can vote on whether the milestone has been met, ensuring that funds are only released when the community is satisfied.
- **Flexible Funding Goals**: Allow projects to specify flexible funding goals where partial funding can still be utilized, depending on project requirements.
- **NFT-Based Contributor Rewards**: Create NFTs as rewards for top contributors, providing unique and collectible recognition for their support.
- **Project Updates**: Allow project creators to post updates about their progress, keeping contributors informed about how the project is evolving.
